Need to link to this file in your HTML template.</li><li>Support Male and Female Names: Set a scope variable for gender, give users a way to set it in your template, and modify the rendered Mad Lib template so that it conditionally displays gender appropriate language (e.g., substituting he/she, him/her, his/her as necessary) according to gender chosen for name.</li>'>

        <p>A word game that dates back to the 1960s and is still around. Users are prompted to supply keywords of their choosing: for instance, a proper name, an adjective, a sport, a dessert item.
