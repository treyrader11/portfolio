    <h2>To Demystify Myself A little</h2>
    <hr class="w3-opacity">
    <p>My name is Trey Matthew Rader, multi-instrumentalist, music enthusiast, idealist, visionary, avid researcher, romantic, and web developer. I am currently enrolled in the <em>Thinkful Flexible Web Development Bootcamp</em> program and have learned an overwhelming amount of material in just 4 months of enrollment. Prior to studying with <em>Thinkful</em>, I taught myself HTML5, CSS3, and native javaScript basics via various online resources.</p>
     <p>In my free time, I enjoy creating and contemplating sounds and noises. Instruments I play include piano, saxophone, clarinet, violin, drums, bass, and guitar. If interested in seeing me perform, you can take a ride over to <em>Pour</em> in River Ranch of Lafayette, where I play jazz piano for brunch every Sunday. </p>

     <p>My background is in anthropology and music composition where I studied at the <em>University of New Orleans</em>. In Fall of 2013, I had arrived at the conclusion that life in academia was no longer for me and made the decision to drop out my jr. year, having relocated from the <em>Crescent City</em> up to Memphis, Tn to pursue a musical career playing organ for the R&B group, <em>Marcella and her Lovers</em>. This new lifestyle in Memphis unfortunately did not go as smooth as I had hoped, however, and so I moved back to my hometown of Lafayette, Louisiana where I began studying jazz piano and Cajun fiddle under the tutelage of Wilson Savoy, manager and frontman of the <em>Pine Leaf Boys</em>. In Lafayette, I've played in a handful of bands out in the community, the <em>Viatones</em>, <em>Rocky & the Grasshoppers</em>, <em>Nightgowns</em>, and sat in with bands such as the <em>Pine Leaf Boys</em>.</p>
     <p>What turned me on to coding initially was the opportunity to work remotely as a freelancer. To me, a remote career would be conducive to the lifestyle of a traveling musician. However, the more in depth I got with my studies and research, the more appealing my new hobby had become. The endless possibilties of possessing a coding skillset quickly became apparent to me, and it was then that I began to start making an earnest attempt to cultivate a garden of code. I have literally dreamed, ate, and lived fruitfully from my new garden, while thoroughly enjoying every minute of it.</p>
