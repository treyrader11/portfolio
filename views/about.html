	<p>Trey Rader is a web developer pursuing a junior developer position to both exercise and further his skills. He is exprienced in fullstack JavaScript development, having worked as a part time and intern software engineer at Torsh Inc. He worked on a large Meteor/Node.js application, where he leveraged his skills in JavaScript and MongoDB to build features, as well as to maintain and debug existing ones.</p>
	<p>While working on the Meteor/Node.js application, Trey built out new features from mocks and specifications. He learned in depth a number of new approaches to software engineering and design patterns, such as pub/sub, job scheduling, and reactivity. He also took on a number of projects on the corporate site, which was a Keystone.js application.</p>
	<p>Prior to studying with the Thinkful Web Development Bootcamp program, he taught himself HTML5, CSS3, and the basics of native JavaScript. He has a personal passion for contributing his skillset to the world by creating educational software, personally feeling that education should be more easily accessible.</p>
	<p>Aside from writing code, Trey enjoys creating and contemplating sounds and noises in his free time. He enjoys playing a handful of instruments, including piano, saxophone, clarinet, violin, drums, bass, and guitar. He has studied jazz piano and Cajun fiddle under the tutelage of Wilson Savoy, manager and frontman of the Pine Leaf Boys, and has taken part in various musical projects out in the community.</p>
	<p>Coding, like music, is a skill that requires a lifetime to master and perfect, and it is this challenging aspect of it that appeals to Trey, who is excited to discover which new framework he'll learn next.</p>
