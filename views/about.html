    <h2>About me</h2>
    <hr class="w3-opacity">
	<p>Hello, my name is Trey Matthew Rader, and I am a web developer pursuing an internship to both exercise and further my skills. I love learning, connecting with others through meaningful conversations, and going on adventures. My most recent adventure has been exploring the vastness of web technology. As of March 2016, I have been living, thinking, and dreaming nothing but web, while thoroughly enjoying every minute of it.</p>
	<p>I am currently enrolled in the Thinkful Web Development Bootcamp program, and prior to studying with Thinkful I taught myself HTML5, CSS3, and the basics of native JavaScript. My goal is to someday contribute my skillset to the world by creating educational software. I personally feel that education should be more easily accessible, and there are never enough ways to teach and explain new concepts.</p>
	<p>Aside from writing code, I enjoy creating and contemplating sounds and noises in my free time. Instruments I play include piano, saxophone, clarinet, violin, drums, bass, and guitar. I have studied jazz piano and Cajun fiddle under the tutelage of Wilson Savoy, manager and frontman of the Pine Leaf Boys, and I've played in a handful of bands out in the community, including the Viatones, Rocky & the Grasshoppers, and Nightgowns. If you are interested in seeing me perform, you can take a ride over to Pour in River Ranch of Lafayette, where I play jazz piano for brunch every Sunday.</p>
	<p>Like music, coding is a skill that requires a lifetime to master and perfect. This challenging aspect of it is one of the main appeals of learning to code, and I'm equally excited as I am curious to see what new language or framework I'll learn next.</p>
