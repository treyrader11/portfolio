	<p>Trey Rader is a web developer pursuing a junior developer position to both exercise and further his skills. He is passionate about changing the lives of people for the better, specifically with creating new methods for teaching and learning. A highschool dropout himself, Trey knows firsthand the need to reform the South Louisiana public school system.</p>
	<p>Trey is currently enrolled in the Thinkful Web Development Bootcamp program. Prior to studying with Thinkful he has taught himself HTML5, CSS3, and the basics of native JavaScript. He aspires to contribute his skillset to the world by creating educational software, personally feeling that education should be more easily accessible, and there are never enough ways to teach and explain new concepts.</p>
	<p>Aside from writing code, Trey enjoys creating and contemplating sounds and noises in his free time. He enjoys playing a handful of intruments, including piano, saxophone, clarinet, violin, drums, bass, and guitar. He has studied jazz piano and Cajun fiddle under the tutelage of Wilson Savoy, manager and frontman of the Pine Leaf Boys, and has taken part in various musical projects out in the community. If interested in seeing Trey perform, you can take a ride over to Pour in River Ranch of Lafayette, where he plays jazz piano for brunch every Sunday.</p>
	<p>Coding, like music, is a skill that requires a lifetime to master and perfect, and it is this challenging aspect of it that appeals to Trey, who is excited to discover which new framework he'll learn next.</p>
