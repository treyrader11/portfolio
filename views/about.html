	<p>Trey Rader is a web developer pursuing an internship to both exercise and further his skills. His passions are learning, connecting with others through meaningful conversations, and discovering new experiences. His most recent discovering is web technology.

	<p>Trey is currently enrolled in the Thinkful Web Development Bootcamp program, and prior to studying with Thinkful has taught himself HTML5, CSS3, and the basics of native JavaScript. A longterm goal of his is to someday contribute his skillset to the world by creating educational software, while he feels that education should be more easily accessible, and there are never enough ways to teach and explain new concepts.</p>
	<p>Aside from writing code, Trey enjoys creating and contemplating sounds and noises in his free time. He plays piano, saxophone, clarinet, violin, drums, bass, and guitar. He has studied jazz piano and Cajun fiddle under the tutelage of Wilson Savoy, manager and frontman of the Pine Leaf Boys, and played in a handful of bands out in the community, including the Viatones, Rocky & the Grasshoppers, and Nightgowns. If interested in seeing Trey perform, you can take a ride over to Pour in River Ranch of Lafayette, where he plays jazz piano for brunch every Sunday.</p>
	<p>Like music, coding is a skill that requires a lifetime to master and perfect, and it is this challenging aspect of it that appeals to Trey, excited to discover which new framework he'll learn next.</p>
