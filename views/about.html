    <p>Yo, I'm Trey and I love playing piano, learning, connecting with others through meaningful conversations, and manifesting adventures, both exciting and crazy. A most recent love of mine has been exploring the vastness of web technology. As of March, 2016, I have been living, thinking, and dreaming nothing but web, while thoroughly enjoying every minute of it.</p>
    <p>Aside from traveling and playing piano in dimly lit dive bars and clubs, it'd be a dream come true to write code for a living. Like music, coding is a skill that one will spend a lifetime perfecting and mastering. This challenging aspect of it is one of the main appeals about learning to code, and I'm equally excited as I am curious to see what new langauges or frameworks I'll learn next. To me, the web is the new intellectual movement; it is the new paradigm shift - the future. </p>
